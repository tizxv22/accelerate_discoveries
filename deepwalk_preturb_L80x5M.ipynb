Note that in regular texts, it makes a lot of sense to work with phrases of various lengths, e.g., \"bank_of_america\", which is a phrase of length 3, but in deepwalk it is not as clear if phrasing will be useful. However, in our initial experiments, we found out that phrasing with `depth=2` improves the result. Setting `depth=0` (by running `embedding.dww2v(path_to_pruned_rws, depth=0)` at the time of instantiation or running `M.pars['depth']=0` after instantiation) will skip the phrasing step.\n",
    "* `phrase_min_count`: A parameter that tells the function to ignore all words and bigrams with total collected count lower than this value\n",
    "* `phrase_threshold`: Represents a score threshold for forming the phrases (higher means fewer phrases). This parameter is tightly connected to the built-in functions that gensim use to perform phrasing."
